# Examotive_PetStore
PetStore Project for Examotive

The maven project is created for automating the UI flows of the Pet-Store application.

The selenium project is based on POM(Page Object Model) design pattern, where for each page of the application we define separate classes. The page class then contains all the webelements and methods defining the functioanlities available on the page. The methods are then called from the test cases.

Here there are total 4 test cases, which can be executed one by one.
